In my personal opinion those are the tools to maintain my system secure also thinking in my team roles, I have included some soft skills that can mitigate or prevent a lack of security.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention:
Use Anti-CSRF Tokens: Embed anti-CSRF tokens in forms and API requests, which are verified on the server to ensure that incoming requests originate from authenticated and authorized users. These tokens, associated with the user's session, are pivotal in preventing CSRF attacks.

Origin Checks: In the battle against CSRF, it's essential to verify that requests are originating from the anticipated sources. Examine the Origin and referred headers in incoming requests, and reject any that do not match the expected origin.

Secure Cookies: Cookies holding session information should be fortified with the HttpOnly and Secure flags. The HttpOnly flag prevents client-side scripts from accessing the cookie, while the Secure flag enforces that the cookie is only transmitted over secure (HTTPS) connections, preventing session fixation and theft.

In the realm of security, it's imperative to firmly communicate that security is indisputable. Tackling these fundamental concerns outlined in the OWASP Top 10 collectively establishes a resilient security cornerstone for our system. Nevertheless, it's vital to acknowledge that the threat landscape is always changing, and security is not a "set it and forget it" task.
Regular security evaluations, code inspections, and penetration testing serve as our proactive instruments for detecting and rectifying vulnerabilities. Additionally, keeping abreast of emerging threats and evolving best practices is an ongoing process.
The OWASP community serves as an invaluable asset for staying up to date with the latest security trends and best practices. In this ever-evolving environment, maintaining a vigilant stance is the key to fortifying the security perimeter around our system.

TO HAVE CONTROL OF MY TEAM
Clear Access Policy Documentation:
Start by developing and documenting an access policy that outlines who has access to what, under what conditions, and what actions are allowed or restricted.

Training and Awareness:
Begin with awareness and training sessions. Conduct workshops or presentations to educate our team about the importance of access control, data security, and their role in maintaining it.

Role-Based Access Control:
Implement role-based access control to systematically manage and control who has access to what. Define roles such as "Software Engineer," "Customer Support," and "Sales." Each role should have predefined access rights.

Access Review and Auditing:
Regularly review and audit user access. Ensure that the access each user has aligns with their role and responsibilities. This prevents over-privileging and unauthorized access.

Access Request and Approval Process:
Establish a process for requesting access or changes to access. Users should submit requests detailing what they need, and the request should be reviewed and approved by an appropriate authority.

Data Classification:
Classify data based on its sensitivity. For example, customer personal information may be classified as highly sensitive, while product documentation might be moderately sensitive. Apply access controls accordingly, with stricter controls for highly sensitive data.

Encryption and Authentication:
Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit. Employ strong authentication mechanisms like multi-factor authentication (MFA) to ensure that only authorized individuals can access systems.

Monitoring and Alerts:
Set up monitoring systems to detect and alert on unusual access patterns or potential security breaches. Immediate detection is key to minimizing damage in case of unauthorized access.

Incident Response Plan:
Prepare an incident response plan in case of a security breach or unauthorized access. Define the steps to take, including containment, analysis, notification, and recovery.

Periodic Security Reviews:
Conduct periodic security reviews and vulnerability assessments. Involve your team in identifying and addressing potential security weaknesses.

Communication Channels:
Establish clear communication channels for reporting security concerns or incidents. Encourage open communication without fear of retaliation.

Legal and Regulatory Compliance:
Ensure that our data access and control policies align with legal and regulatory compliance requirements specific to our industry.

Feedback Loop:
Maintain an open feedback loop with your team. Allow them to voice concerns, questions, or suggestions regarding security practices. Address these promptly.

Penetration Testing:
Consider conducting penetration tests or vulnerability assessments to proactively identify security weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them.

Consequences and Accountability:
Clearly communicate the consequences of violating security policies. Enforce accountability for unauthorized access or breaches.

Access Revocation:
When team members change roles or leave the organization, promptly revoke their access. Ex-employees' accounts should be deactivated to prevent unauthorized access.

Privacy and Data Protection:
Educate our team about the importance of customer privacy and data protection. Stress the significance of maintaining trust with customers.

Documentation and Reporting:
Maintain comprehensive documentation of access changes, incidents, and resolutions. Reporting ensures transparency and accountability.

Continuous Improvement:
Continuously assess and improve our security measures. Stay updated on emerging threats and adjust our security strategy accordingly.

External Security Experts:
Consider bringing in external security experts for audits and assessments to ensure an unbiased evaluation of our security practices.

By adopting these measures and fostering a security-conscious culture, we can mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents. Moreover, our team members will understand their responsibilities and the critical role they play in upholding security.
